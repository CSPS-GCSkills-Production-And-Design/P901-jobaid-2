            <h2>Choosing Assessment Methods and Tools</h2>
            <h3>Key Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Candidates must be assessed to determine if they meet <strong>each</strong> merit criteria. The essential qualifications must be met, at a minimum, for the person to be qualified.</li>
                <li>The merit criteria can be assessed in any order.</li>
                <li>Candidates can be eliminated as soon as it is determined they do not meet an essential qualification and any of the other merit criteria that may be established (i.e. asset qualifications, operational requirements or organizational needs).</li>
                <li>The sub-delegated manager has the authority to use any assessment method they consider appropriate.</li>
                <li>The use of more than one source of information can reduce personal bias and allow candidates that are more or less comfortable with a particular assessment method, to fully demonstrate their qualifications.</li>
                <li>The assessment tools must be administered fairly, which does not necessarily mean using the same assessment tools for all candidates.</li>
                <li>An assessment board may include multiple assessors for additional perspectives to support diversity and inclusion and manage personal bias. You may also have a single assessor if it makes sense given the type of process and the nature of the qualifications.</li>
                <li>Choose and train assessment board members to ensure an impartial process.</li>
                <li>Various people may be responsible for assessing the same merit criteria. Ensure there is consistency and that the information gathered can be combined to fairly determine the merit of each candidate assessed.</li>
                <li>The sub-delegated manager retains the authority to make the hiring decisions. The assessment board is responsible for obtaining information on the candidate&rsquo;s qualifications.</li>
                <li>Linking expected answers or behavioural indicators of the qualifications to the work to be performed will allow you to fairly assess candidates against the job requirements and help avoid comparing candidates to each other.</li>
                <li>In general, job-specific knowledge can be acquired once on the job, with the exception of expertise-driven professions. When designing knowledge assessment tools, it is important to only expect a knowledge level that is required on the first day of the job. Managers may design their own assessment tools or use existing tools, including standardized tests from the <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/human-resources-toolbox/personnel-psychology-centre.html">PSC Personnel Psychology Centre</a>.</li>

                <p>When choosing an assessment method, you may consider the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cost, <strong>time</strong> and other resources needed for administration. The more urgent the staffing need, the more you may want to consider some methods and not others.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>importance of the qualification</strong> being assessed. If the qualification is important, it might be worthwhile to put in the time and resources required for a thorough assessment.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>type of qualification.</strong> Certain qualifications lend themselves more easily to certain tools.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>work context</strong> in which the qualification applies: Consider selecting an assessment tool that reflects the requirements of the position.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>number and location of candidates</strong>. Selection of an assessment method may depend on the anticipated number of candidates or the area of selection.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>shortcomings</strong> of various assessment <strong>methods</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>type of staffing process,</strong>g. advertised vs. non-advertised, may lead you to choose different methods of assessment.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility and inclusion, by using the <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/public-service-hiring-guides/enhance-fairness-reduce-bias-assessment-tools.html">Fairness Review Checklist</a> developed by the Public Service Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

                <h2><strong>Assessment Practices</strong></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active assessment information</strong> refers to information obtained directly from candidates or other persons. It requires development and administration but can be tailored to meet specific needs. Consider if your own biases are leading you to seek information that corroborates your impressions, or if it validates the candidate&rsquo;s actual qualifications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passive assessment information </strong>makes use of existing sources that were gathered and recorded for a different purpose such as degrees and certificates, letters of reference, samples or work, an assessment for an unrelated appointment process, or a performance assessment. This method may save time associated with development and administration of assessment tools and provide a valid source of assessment information, or information that can be easily validated from other sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sources of information</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Candidates</strong> provide information on their resumes or job applications, or through written tests, interviews and other means. Consider that many candidates are putting their best foot forward, which may lead to exaggeration and false claims.&nbsp; Other candidates may under-rate their own contribution or provide vague generalities.&nbsp; Consider how to clarify and supplement the candidate&rsquo;s information by probing for specific details about their role or validating it by seeking information from other sources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other persons, such as supervisors, colleagues, clients and direct reports </strong>can provide you with information through written and verbal references. Each has their own bias, which may lead to more positive or negative conclusions than you would draw in the same circumstance. Consider probing for specific examples, examining the context of these remarks, and validating it by seeking information from other sources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct personal knowledge </strong>refers to the situation where the sub-delegated manager or a member of the assessment board has direct knowledge of the candidate that could be used as a reference, in another circumstance. It is difficult to disregard personal knowledge, even if you recuse yourself from assessing this one candidate, so the key is to consider how it can be incorporated into the assessment. Make the links to the merit criteria and consider validating by seeking information from other sources.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What form is the information?</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Verbal</strong> information is usually recorded by assessors taking notes but may also include audio and video recordings (with proper permission, classification and storage). The notes are used to assist in recall to complete the assessment.&nbsp; This method allows for active probing and adaptation to the unique context of the candidate to ensure you gather information that is complete.&nbsp; Consider pre-planning interview questions and assigning roles to the assessors to ensure that the requirement to record notes does not interfere with the dialogue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Written</strong> information may be requested through the job application, written tests and reference questionnaires. Some statements in an email may be sufficient, such as an employment equity self-declaration.&nbsp; Other times, a candidate showing that they meet a qualification may include documents such as diplomas or letters.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment Accommodation</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessment accommodation is a change made to an assessment procedure, format or content. It is designed to remove barriers for a fair assessment and allow candidates to fully demonstrate their competency.</li>
                            <li>The assessment may be modified to provide accommodation for any of the grounds of discrimination set out in the <em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em>. The candidate does not have to self-declare as a person with a disability to request an accommodation measure.</li>
                            <li>People have the right to request assessment accommodation based on any of the human rights grounds. The right to request it does not necessarily mean that candidates will be accommodated, however. Delegated managers have the responsibility to determine assessment accommodations based on the limitations of the candidate and the work requirements; the objective is to remove barriers and not to lift candidates from their obligation to meet merit requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-uppercase">Important </strong>Therefore, when considering accommodation measures, the changes to the assessment procedure or modifications to the content of the assessment should not alter the nature or level of the qualification being assessed.</li>
                            <li>Assessment accommodations are one important means to make the assessment process more accessible and inclusive. Other means include the development of tests and assessments methods which are universal by design. It also includes the development of merit criteria, which include many ways to achieve the work requirements. Inclusive and accessible assessment is also supported by the development of adapted formats.&nbsp;</li>
